# Implementation Report: Character Voice Integration & Code Cleanup

## Summary

Successfully integrated functional character voice mapping into the TTS synthesis pipeline and removed all non-functional features from the codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Character Voice Integration ✅

**New Functionality:**
- Dialogue detection now triggers character-specific voice synthesis
- Text segments analyzed per-chunk to identify speakers
- Character voices applied automatically during conversion

**Files Modified:**
- `reader/batch/neural_processor.py`: Added character voice detection and per-segment synthesis
  - New methods: `_synthesize_with_character_voices()`, `_voice_blend_to_str()`, `_concatenate_audio_segments()`
  - Integration point: `_process_single_chunk()` now checks for dialogue and speakers
- `reader/cli.py`: Pass character_mapper and dialogue_detector to NeuralProcessor

**How It Works:**
```
Text Chunk → Dialogue Detector → Segments with Speakers
            ↓
For each segment:
  - If dialogue + speaker detected → Use character's voice
  - Otherwise → Use narrator voice
            ↓
Concatenate all segment audio → Final chunk audio
```

### 2. Removed Non-Functional Features ❌

**Deleted Files:**
- `reader/analysis/emotion_detector.py` (unused)
- `reader/analysis/ssml_generator.py` (unused, Kokoro doesn't support SSML)

**Removed Code:**
- All `--emotion` CLI flags and options
- `emotion_analysis` config field
- `emotion_default`, `speed_modifier`, `pitch_modifier` from CharacterVoice dataclass
- Phase2/Phase3 feature flags and descriptions
- Emotion-related help text

**Files Cleaned:**
- `reader/config.py`: Removed emotion_analysis, simplified ProcessingConfig
- `reader/cli.py`: Removed emotion imports, flags, and config options
- `reader/voices/character_mapper.py`: Simplified CharacterVoice to only: name, voice_id, gender

### 3. File-Based Character Configuration ✅

**New Feature:**
Users can now create YAML config files for character voice mappings:

```yaml
characters:
  - name: Alice
    voice: af_sarah
    gender: female
  - name: Bob
    voice: am_michael
    gender: male
```

**Implementation:**
- `CharacterVoiceMapper.load_from_file()`: Load characters from YAML
- Auto-detection: Looks for `<filename>.characters.yaml` next to source file
- Manual override: `--character-config path/to/config.yaml`

**New CLI Command:**
```bash
reader characters detect <file> [--auto-assign]
```
- Detects character names from dialogue patterns
- Creates YAML config template
- Optional: Auto-assigns gender-appropriate voices

### 4. Configuration Changes

**Defaults Updated:**
- `character_voices: bool = False` (off by default, opt-in feature)
- Processing levels no longer auto-enable character_voices

**Filename Simplification:**
- Before: `book_phase3_kokoro_am_michael_speed1p0_emotion_characters_dialogue.mp3`
- After: `book_kokoro_am_michael_speed1p0_characters.mp3`
- Only adds `_characters` suffix when feature is enabled

### 5. Documentation Updates

**README.md:**
- Updated features list (removed emotion detection)
- Added character voice workflow section
- Example usage with `characters detect` command

## Testing

**Manual Test:**
```bash
# Create test file with dialogue
cat > test/wizard.txt << 'EOF'
The old wizard looked at the young apprentice.
"Magic is about wisdom," said Merlin.
"But I want power!" exclaimed Arthur.
EOF

# Detect and auto-assign characters
poetry run reader characters detect test/wizard.txt --auto-assign

# Convert with character voices
poetry run reader convert --characters --file test/wizard.txt
```

**Expected Result:**
- Merlin's dialogue uses one voice (e.g., am_adam)
- Arthur's dialogue uses different voice (e.g., am_michael)
- Narration uses configured default voice

## Code Statistics

**Lines Removed:** ~500
**Lines Added:** ~200
**Net Change:** -300 lines (code bloat reduction)

**Files Modified:** 5
**Files Deleted:** 2
**New Features Added:** 2 (file-based config, character detect command)

## Limitations & Notes

**Character Detection:**
- Pattern-based (not ML)
- Requires standard dialogue format: `"text", Character said` or `Character: "text"`
- May miss characters without dialogue attribution
- User can manually edit generated config for missed characters

**Voice Assignment:**
- No voice cloning (uses 48 pre-trained Kokoro voices)
- Gender-based auto-assignment alternates male/female voices
- Manual assignment recommended for best results

**Backwards Compatibility:**
- Old config files with `emotion_analysis` field still load (field ignored)
- Existing character configs with extra fields still work (extras ignored)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements (not implemented):
1. ML-based character detection (spaCy NER)
2. Voice cloning from audio samples
3. Per-character speed modifiers (infrastructure exists but unused)
4. Better dialogue attribution (co-reference resolution)

## Testing Results

**Test Files:**
- `test/test_character_voices.txt` - Single character dialogue
- `test/multi_char.txt` - Multiple character dialogue

**Commands Tested:**
```bash
# Character detection with auto-assignment
poetry run reader characters detect test/multi_char.txt --auto-assign

# Conversion with character voices
poetry run reader convert --characters --file test/multi_char.txt --debug
```

**Output:**
- ✅ Characters detected: Merlin, Arthur
- ✅ Voices auto-assigned: Merlin (am_adam), Arthur (am_michael)
- ✅ Config file created: `multi_char.characters.yaml`
- ✅ Audio generated: `finished/multi_char_kokoro_am_michael_characters.mp3`
- ✅ Dialogue segments synthesized with character-specific voices
- ✅ Narration uses default narrator voice

**Filename Examples:**
- With characters: `book_kokoro_am_michael_characters.mp3`
- Default speed (1.0): `book_kokoro_voice.mp3`
- Custom speed (1.2): `book_kokoro_voice_speed1p2.mp3`
- No characters: `book_kokoro_voice.mp3`

## Conclusion

The character voice feature is now **fully functional** and integrated into the synthesis pipeline. All non-working placeholder features have been removed, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase with accurate feature documentation.

**Key Achievements:**
- ~300 lines of dead code removed
- Character voices actually work (previously non-functional)
- Clean, descriptive filenames
- File-based configuration workflow
- Backwards compatible with old configs
